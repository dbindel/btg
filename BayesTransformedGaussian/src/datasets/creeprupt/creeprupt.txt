   * 4. Carbon
   * 5. Silicon
   * 6. Manganese
   * 7. Phosphorus
   * 8. Sulphur
   * 9. Chromium
   * 10. Molybdenum
   * 11. Tungsten
   * 12. Nickel
   * 13. Copper
   * 14. Vanadium
   * 15. Niobium
   * 16. Nitrogen
   * 17. Aluminium
   * 18. Boron
   * 19. Cobalt
   * 20. Tantalum
   * 21. Oxygen

Column 22 Normalising temperature / Kelvin

Column 23 Normalising time / hours

Column 24 Cooling rate of normalisation :-

   * 0 - furnace cooling.
   * 1 - air cooling.
   * 2 - oil quench.
   * 3 - water quench.

Column 25 Tempering temperature / Kelvin

Column 26 Tempering time / hours

Column 27 Cooling rate of tempering / (0-3 as for normalisation)

Column 28 Annealing temperature / Kelvin

Further Comments

The database was supplied by the Dr Takahashi Yoshida and used to train a
neural network which enabled us to model the creep properties of steels.
